# 🧱 FluxBrick™ – Open Source DIY Housing Block System

**FluxBrick™** is a lightweight, interlocking, structurally optimized panel/block system engineered for DIY home construction. Designed for 3D printing, rapid assembly, and long-term durability, FluxBrick is the first open-source modular building block intended to **revolutionize low-cost, resilient housing**.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

The goal of FluxBrick is to democratize construction by making it **affordable, scalable, and strong enough** for real-world shelter — all while being printable on standard desktop or commercial 3D printers. Think **Lego meets concrete**, optimized for the 21st century.

## 📦 What’s Inside This Repo

- `fluxbrick_test_block.stl`  
  A starter 3D-printable prototype of the FluxBrick block (10” x 6” x 6” equivalent)

- `fluxbrick_dimensions.svg`  
  Schematic with block geometry and spacing

- `assembly-guide.md`  
  Step-by-step instructions on how to assemble walls with FluxBrick blocks

- `bill-of-materials.md`  
  Optional insulation and reinforcement materials list (e.g., spray foam, rebar rods)

- `print-settings.md`  
  Recommended slicer and printer settings for FDM printers (e.g., H2D, Prusa, Bambu)

## 🧩 How It Works

- **Interlocking Design**: Blocks snap together vertically and horizontally via tongue-and-groove and keyway features
- **Optimized Geometry**: Ribbed internal grid distributes loads efficiently while keeping material use low
- **Insulation Ready**: Interior cavities can be filled with closed-cell spray foam or left hollow (air = R-2/inch)
- **Stackable**: Reversible design enables stacking like bricks — perfect for walls, partitions, and more
- **Printable**: Designed to print without supports and fit within most hobbyist printer beds (200–300mm)
